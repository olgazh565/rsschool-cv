# About me

I am 43 years old and I started to learn front-end development just recently. Before I did not know anything about it and was just an ordinary user. All my previous jobs were in retale, wholesale and banks. My most resent job was in a bank for 8,5 years until I got fired because on the stuff reduction in 2020. Since then I was figuring out what new profession I want to learn that will allow me to work from any country in the world, because my goal is to relocate from Belarus where I live now. And finally I thought of web-development. I have already attended some paid courses of HTML and CSS. And also I am currently learning JavaScript and React at another paid courses. But I was not satisfied with the level of teaching there so I was looking for some better courses as an alternative and I found out about RS school. I like to learn new things and learning frontend development is very interesting to me. I am a very persistant and responsible person and it helps me in my learning too. Also I always try to do things in the best possible way, a bit of a perfectionist, I admit.
